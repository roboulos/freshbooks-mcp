# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Secure Your Xano Instance

## What Happened
Your Xano instance URL was hardcoded in the public codebase. This has been fixed, but you need to take immediate action.

## Immediate Steps (Won't Break Your App)

### 1. Deploy the Fixed Version
```bash
# The app will continue working during deployment
wrangler deploy
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Cloudflare Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to: Workers & Pages > xano-mcp-server > Settings > Variables
3. Add these variables:
   - `XANO_BASE_URL` = `https://your-instance.xano.io`
   - `COOKIE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` = Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

### 3. Verify Security
- Check your Xano dashboard for any unauthorized access
- Review your API logs for suspicious activity
- Consider rotating your Xano API keys if you see any unauthorized access

## How The Fix Works
- The code now uses environment variables instead of hardcoded URLs
- If environment variables aren't set, it shows warnings but doesn't crash
- Your instance URL is no longer exposed in the source code

## For Maximum Security
1. **Rotate Your Xano API Keys** (if you suspect unauthorized access)
2. **Enable IP Whitelisting** in Xano if available
3. **Monitor Access Logs** regularly
4. **Never commit** sensitive data to git

## Testing The Secure Version
```bash
# Check that environment variables are working
wrangler tail

# Look for any warning messages about missing environment variables
```

The app will continue working throughout this process. No downtime required!
