Expected: List of invoices with client names and amounts
```

#### Step 3: Preview Saturday Send
```

Expected: Shows what would be sent
```

#### Step 4: Send for Real

### If Something Goes Wrong

1. **"FreshBooks Not Connected"**
   - Go to mcp.snappy.ai
   - Click "Connect FreshBooks"
   - Complete OAuth flow

2. **"Invalid token"**
   - FreshBooks token might be expired
   - Reconnect on mcp.snappy.ai

3. **"No draft invoices"**
   - Check FreshBooks directly
   - Create test invoice if needed

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All draft invoices sent
- [ ] Time logged for the week
- [ ] No manual FreshBooks login needed
- [ ] Total time: < 2 minutes

### Bonus: Create Demo Video
After successful test:
```
You: "I just automated my Saturday invoicing in 30 seconds with MCP!"
*Start screen recording*
*Show the conversation with Claude*
*Post to LinkedIn/Twitter*
```

## üéØ The Dream Achieved
From: 30 minutes of manual invoicing
To: 30 seconds of "Send Saturday invoices"
