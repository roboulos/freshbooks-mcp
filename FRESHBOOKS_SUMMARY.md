# FreshBooks MCP - Architecture Summary

## 🎯 The Big Picture

You were right! Here's how it works:

### Current Flow (Xano MCP)
1. User connects to MCP → Logs into Xano → Gets `api_key` → Uses Xano tools

### New Flow (FreshBooks MCP)
1. User connects to MCP → Logs into Xano → Gets `freshbooks_key` → Uses FreshBooks tools

**Xano stays as the authentication backend for ALL your MCP tools!**

## 🔑 Key Insights

1. **Xano = User Management System**
   - Handles login/authentication
   - Stores user profiles
   - Stores API keys for various services

2. **FreshBooks = Just Another API**
   - User connects FreshBooks on mcp.snappy.ai
   - Token stored in their Xano account
   - MCP retrieves it like any other user data

3. **No OAuth in MCP**
   - All OAuth happens on mcp.snappy.ai
   - MCP just reads the stored tokens
   - Super clean and simple

## 📝 What Changes in the Code

### Minimal Changes Required:
1. **Props Interface**: Add `freshbooksKey: string | null`
2. **OAuth Callback**: Extract `freshbooks_key` from user data
3. **Tools**: Replace Xano tools with FreshBooks tools
4. **Environment**: Add `FRESHBOOKS_ACCOUNT_ID`

That's it! 95% of the code stays the same.

## 🚀 Saturday Invoice Automation

With this setup, your Saturday routine becomes:
```
You: "Send all draft invoices"
Claude: *uses freshbooks_send_saturday_invoices tool*
Claude: "✅ Sent 3 invoices totaling $4,250"
```

## 🎉 Why This is Brilliant

1. **You already built the hard part** (OAuth with Xano)
2. **Adding new services is trivial** (QuickBooks, Stripe, etc.)
3. **Users manage everything on mcp.snappy.ai**
4. **Each MCP server stays focused** on one API
5. **Ray was right** - build MCP for companies with APIs!

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Copy template → freshbooks-mcp
2. Make the 4 small changes above
3. Deploy to Cloudflare
4. Add FreshBooks OAuth to mcp.snappy.ai
5. Test with your Saturday invoicing
6. Ship it! 🚢

This follows Ray's advice perfectly - take an existing API (FreshBooks) and make it accessible through MCP. The 90-day window is your chance to be the go-to MCP for invoicing!
