# Recent Fixes and Improvements

This document details the specific fixes and improvements made in the latest update to the Xano MCP Server.

## Schema Manipulation Fixes

### Issue: `xano_add_field_to_schema` Tool Not Working Correctly

**Problem Description:**
The schema field addition tool was causing errors when attempting to add fields to tables. The primary issues were:
1. Overly complex implementation that didn't match the simpler Python SDK approach
2. Not handling empty schema responses correctly
3. Incorrect handling of API response formats (array vs. object with schema property)

**Solution:**
1. Completely rewrote the `xano_add_field_to_schema` implementation to match the Python SDK pattern:
   ```typescript
   // First get the current schema
   const schemaResult = await makeApiRequest(schemaUrl, token);
   
   // In Python this is wrapped in {"schema": result}, but we'll handle both formats
   const currentSchema = Array.isArray(schemaResult) ? schemaResult : schemaResult.schema || [];
   
   // Create the new field
   const newField = {
     name: field_name,
     type: field_type,
     // other properties...
   };
   
   // Add the new field to the schema (simply append, just like Python implementation)
   const updatedSchema = [...currentSchema, newField];
   
   // Prepare data for updating schema - follow exactly the Python pattern
   const data = { schema: updatedSchema };
   
   // Update the schema
   const result = await makeApiRequest(schemaUrl, token, "PUT", data);
   ```

2. Added better handling for different schema response formats
3. Added proper error handling for empty responses
4. Added logging to track schema structure and API responses for debugging

## Record Management Improvements

### Issue: Incorrect API Endpoint Paths

**Problem Description:**
The record management tools were using incorrect API endpoint paths (`/row` instead of `/content`), causing 404 errors when trying to access records.

**Solution:**
1. Fixed all endpoint paths to use `/content` instead of `/row`:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const url = `${metaApi}/workspace/${formatId(workspace_id)}/table/${formatId(table_id)}/row/${formatId(record_id)}`;
   
   // After
   const url = `${metaApi}/workspace/${formatId(workspace_id)}/table/${formatId(table_id)}/content/${formatId(record_id)}`;
   ```

2. Updated all record-related tools to use the correct endpoints
3. Added extensive logging to verify API paths

### Issue: Insufficient Error Handling for Null Responses

**Problem Description:**
DELETE operations often return null or empty responses when successful, which was causing errors in the tools.

**Solution:**
1. Enhanced the `makeApiRequest` function to better handle different response types:
   ```typescript
   // Handle 204 No Content responses (common for DELETE operations)
   if (response.status === 204) {
     return { success: true, message: "Operation completed successfully" };
   }
   
   // If not a JSON response, handle differently
   const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type');
   if (!contentType || !contentType.includes('application/json')) {
     if (!response.ok) {
       return { error: `HTTP Error: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}` };
     }
     return { success: true, message: "Operation completed successfully" };
   }
   ```

2. Added special handling for empty/null responses in record deletion tools:
   ```typescript
   // Handle response including null/empty responses which are common for DELETE operations
   if (result && result.error) {
     return {
       content: [{ type: "text", text: `Error: ${result.error}` }]
     };
   }
   
   return {
     content: [{
       type: "text",
       text: JSON.stringify(result || { success: true, message: "Record deleted successfully" })
     }]
   };
   ```

### Issue: Missing Record Management Tools

**Problem Description:**
The implementation was missing several important record management tools, limiting its usefulness.

**Solution:**
1. Added several new record management tools:
   - `xano_create_table_record`: Creates individual records
   - `xano_update_table_record`: Updates individual records
   - `xano_delete_table_record`: Deletes individual records
   - `xano_bulk_create_records`: Creates multiple records in one operation
   - `xano_bulk_update_records`: Updates multiple records in one operation

2. Each tool follows consistent patterns for authentication, error handling, and parameter validation

## General Reliability Improvements

### Issue: Unstable Response Handling

**Problem Description:**
The API response handling was not robust enough to handle various response formats from Xano.

**Solution:**
1. Completely rewrote the `makeApiRequest` function to handle:
   - Empty responses
   - Non-JSON responses
   - 204 No Content responses
   - Response parsing errors

2. Added proper type checking before accessing properties:
   ```typescript
   // Before
   if (result.error) { ... }
   
   // After
   if (result && result.error) { ... }
   ```

3. Added fallback values for successful but empty responses:
   ```typescript
   return {
     content: [{
       type: "text",
       text: JSON.stringify(result || { success: true, message: "Operation completed successfully" })
     }]
   };
   ```

### Issue: Problematic Tool Causing Claude to Crash

**Problem Description:**
The `xano_search_table_content` tool was causing Claude to crash during execution due to complex query structures.

**Solution:**
1. Completely removed the problematic tool from the implementation
2. Added a comment indicating it was removed due to causing crashes

## Conclusion

These improvements have significantly enhanced the reliability and functionality of the Xano MCP Server. By adopting patterns that match the proven Python SDK implementation and improving error handling throughout, we've resolved the critical issues with schema manipulation and record management.

The server now provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing Xano databases, tables, schemas, and records, all while maintaining robust error handling and consistent authentication patterns.
